        <p>
            Hello! My name is Seth VanMeter.  I have multiple hobbies and skills.  I am most proud of the eight years I served in the United States Army as a Radar Operator. 
             Mostly because not mant can say that at my age.  Additionally, I have multiple years of experience in manufacturing. 
             However, after being diagnosed with Arthritis; I want to slow things down so I can enjoy life a little more. 
             I currently live in Olathe, Kansas with my wife and daughter.  On my free time, I like to golf or go to the lake.  I'm also pretty skilled on a guitar. 
            If I had to describe my personality; I would say I am a guy that likes to hear my own voice, but that leaves me to be the first one to speak and makes me very outgoing!
